*Python- can be used on a server to create web applications.
*Python- Is a versatile and beginner friendly programming language widely used in web development
*To run a Python: python hello.py

*Basic data types: Floating-point number represent numbers with decimals.
*String- represent sequence of characters enclosed in qoutes.
*Boolean- represent one/two values(true or false)

->Compound Data Types.
*List-Collection of items that can contain elements of different data types. 
*Tuple-List but tuples immutable meaning once they are created they  cannot be changed.
*Dictionary(dict)-A collection of key-values pairs.Values can be of any data
*Set-An unordered collection of unique elements.

->Ttpe Conversion.
*Implicit-python automatically converts one data type to another when necessary.
Adding an Integer to a float results in a Float.
*Explicit-You can manually convert one data type to another using functions.

->Operators and Expressions.
*Operators-are symbols in python that perform operations on variables and values.
*Expressions-is a combination of values, variablbles and operators THAT python interprets & evaluates to produce a result.
Example: 2+3 is an expression that evaluates to 5

-> Control Structure(if-else/loops).

*Conditional Structure- if else.
 -if statement:execute block of code if the condition is TRUE.
 -Else if(elif)statement:checks another condition if the PREVIOUS condition was false.
 -Else:Execute a block of code if ALL previous were false.

*Loops-Loops allow you to repeat of block of multiple times: ( For loops/ While loops)
 -For loop:Iterate over a sequence  and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.
 -While loop: repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.

->COMBINING IF-ELSE WITH LOOPS.
 -
 -
->FUNCTIONS AND MODULES.
*FUNCTIONS.
 -Functions:are block of code that perform a specefic task.
 -they allow you to break down your code into smaller manageable pieces.
 -
*MODULES.
 -Modules are files that contain Python codes.
