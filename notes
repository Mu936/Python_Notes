*Python- can be used on a server to create web applications.
*Python- Is a versatile and beginner friendly programming language widely used in web development
*To run a Python: python hello.py

*Basic data types: Floating-point number represent numbers with decimals.
*String- represent sequence of characters enclosed in qoutes.
*Boolean- represent one/two values(true or false)

->Compound Data Types.
*List-Collection of items that can contain elements of different data types. 
*Tuple-List but tuples immutable meaning once they are created they  cannot be changed.
*Dictionary(dict)-A collection of key-values pairs.Values can be of any data
*Set-An unordered collection of unique elements.

->Ttpe Conversion.
*Implicit-python automatically converts one data type to another when necessary.
Adding an Integer to a float results in a Float.
*Explicit-You can manually convert one data type to another using functions.

->Operators and Expressions.
*Operators-are symbols in python that perform operations on variables and values.
*Expressions-is a combination of values, variablbles and operators THAT python interprets & evaluates to produce a result.
Example: 2+3 is an expression that evaluates to 5

-> Control Structure(if-else/loops).

*Conditional Structure- if else.
 -if statement:execute block of code if the condition is TRUE.
 -Else if(elif)statement:checks another condition if the PREVIOUS condition was false.
 -Else:Execute a block of code if ALL previous were false.

*Loops-Loops allow you to repeat of block of multiple times: ( For loops/ While loops)
 -For loop:Iterate over a sequence  and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.
 -While loop: repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.

->COMBINING IF-ELSE WITH LOOPS.
 -
 -
->FUNCTIONS AND MODULES.
*Functions.
 -Functions:are block of code that perform a specefic task.
 -they allow you to break down your code into smaller manageable pieces.
 -
*Modules.
 -Modules are files that contain Python codes.

Pandas
Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series, which allow for easy handling of structured data. With Pandas, you can efficiently load data from various file formats (like CSV, Excel, etc.), perform operations such as filtering, grouping, and aggregating data, and manage missing values. Itâ€™s particularly useful for preprocessing and cleaning data before analysis or visualization.

Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a widely-used plotting library in Python that provides a flexible framework for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It allows you to generate a wide variety of plots, such as line charts, bar graphs, histograms, and scatter plots. Matplotlib is highly customizable, enabling users to modify plot elements like titles, labels, legends, and styles to suit their needs. It serves as the foundation for many other visualization libraries in Python.

Seaborn
Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and offers a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. It simplifies the process of creating complex visualizations, making it easier to explore and present data. Seaborn includes built-in themes and color palettes that enhance the aesthetic appeal of plots. It also provides convenient functions for visualizing relationships in data, such as scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps, and it works seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames, allowing for easy integration with data manipulation tasks.
